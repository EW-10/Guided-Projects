From kaggle, on above link to dataset: “The data is collected from the Our World in Data website, which contains information about the deaths and the vaccination happening worldwide over a time frame of February 2020 till May 2022. 
Data as of 5th May 2022.”

In my project I have analysed total cases and total vaccinations data per continent for data from the 31/12/2021.
